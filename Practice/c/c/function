functions are two types
     (1) pre-defined functions
     (2) user-defined functions
whenever there is a term called functions in c lagguage we need to think of three points
      (i) function declaration
      (ii) function call
      (iii) function call
(1)pre-defined funct5ions:  In pre-defined function 
    * function is declared at <stdio.h>
    * function is called within the main function
    * function is defined at <>
(2)user-defined functions: in user-defined
    * function is declared before the main function
    *function is called within the main function
    * function is defined after the main function
